          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Noubar Afeyan, a Sloan professor and founder of Flagship Ventures, recently argued during Harvard’s Spark conference that we should better distinguish between the term <em>entrepreneurship</em>, where “ship” implies a certain constancy, and <em>entrepreneuring</em>, which describes in his words the <em>process</em> of building up an enterprise and has a much stronger connotation of fluency and evolution. This idea of understanding the process of founding companies as a profession on its own that can be taught, serially applied, and improved upon is in my view an almost inevitable conclusion of the evolution of strategic management over the last century. The last 100 years have seen a substantial transition from managers seeing the world as predictable and their companies as self-contained to a focus on surviving in a highly complex, evolving, and interdepended&nbsp;world.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>Surprisingly, Dokku (and also Heroku) <a href="https://github.com/progrium/buildstep/blob/master/builder/config/buildpacks.txt">doesn’t offer</a> you a straightforward option to deploy static websites. Sure, a lot of websites are anyway dynamic nowadays, but there is still plenty of need for static pages such as blogs created by the likes of <a href="http://wintersmith.io/">Wintersmith</a>.</p>
<p>The following steps will show you how to make it anyway happen with the help of a <a href="https://github.com/florianheinemann/buildpack-nginx">custom buildpack</a> that I’ve been working on. What it does is to compile and deploy a lightweight <a href="http://nginx.org/"><span class="caps">NGINX</span></a> instance that serves all the&nbsp;files.</p>

          <section class="content"><p><a href="https://passwordless.net">Passwordless</a> is an authentication middleware for Node.js that improves security for your users while being fast and easy to&nbsp;deploy.</p>
<p>The last months were very exciting for everyone interested in web security and privacy: Fantastic <a href="https://medium.com/@ninjudd/passwords-are-obsolete-9ed56d483eb">articles</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7943365">discussions</a>, and talks but also plenty of <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/hackers-attack-cracked-10-banks-in-major-assault/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0">incidents</a> that raised&nbsp;awareness. </p>
<p>Most websites are, however, still stuck with the same authentication mechanism as from the earliest days of the web: username and&nbsp;password.</p>
