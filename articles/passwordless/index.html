          <section class="content"><p><a href="https://passwordless.net">Passwordless</a> is an authentication middleware for Node.js that improves security for your users while being fast and easy to&nbsp;deploy.</p>
<p>The last months were very exciting for everyone interested in web security and privacy: Fantastic <a href="https://medium.com/@ninjudd/passwords-are-obsolete-9ed56d483eb">articles</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7943365">discussions</a>, and talks but also plenty of <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/hackers-attack-cracked-10-banks-in-major-assault/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0">incidents</a> that raised&nbsp;awareness. </p>
<p>Most websites are, however, still stuck with the same authentication mechanism as from the earliest days of the web: username and&nbsp;password.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>While username and password have their place, we should be much more challenging if they are the <em>right</em> solution for our projects. We know that most people use the <a href="http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/04/23/users-same-password-most-websites/">same password</a> on all the sites they visit. For projects without dedicated security experts, should we really open up our users to the risk that a breach of our site also compromises their Amazon account? Also, the classic mechanism has by default at least two attack vectors: the login page and the password recovery page. Especially the latter is often implemented hurried and hence inherently more&nbsp;risky.</p>
<p>We’ve seen quite a bit of <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/">great ideas</a> and I got particularly excited by one very straightforward and low-tech solution: One-time passwords. They are fast to implement, have a small attack surface, and require neither <span class="caps">QR</span> codes nor JavaScript. Whenever a user wants to login or has her session invalidated, she receives a short-lived one-time link with a token via email or text message. If you want to give it a spin, feel free to test the demo on <a href="https://passwordless.net">passwordless.net</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately—depending on your technology stack—there a few to none ready-made solutions out there. <a href="https://passswordless.net">Passwordless</a> changes this for&nbsp;Node.js.</p>
<h1 id="getting-started-on-node-js-express">Getting started on Node.js <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Express</h1>
<p>Getting started with Passwordless is straight-forward and you’ll be able to deploy a fully fledged and secure authentication solution for a small project within two&nbsp;hours:</p>
<p><code>$ npm install passwordless --save</code></p>
<p>gets you the basic framework. You’ll also want to install one of the existing <a href="https://passwordless.net/plugins">storage interfaces</a> such as <a href="https://github.com/florianheinemann/passwordless-mongostore">MongoStore</a> which store the tokens&nbsp;securely:</p>
<p><code>$ npm install passwordless-mongostore --save</code></p>
<p>To deliver the tokens to the users, email would be the most common option (but text message is also feasible) and you’re free to pick any of the existing email frameworks such&nbsp;as:</p>
<p><code>$ npm install emailjs --save</code></p>
<h1 id="setting-up-the-basics">Setting up the&nbsp;basics</h1>
<p>Let’s require all of the above mentioned modules in the same file that you use to initialise&nbsp;Express:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="keyword">var</span> passwordless = <span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">'passwordless'</span>);
<span class="keyword">var</span> MongoStore = <span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">'passwordless-mongostore'</span>);
<span class="keyword">var</span> email   = <span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">"emailjs"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>If you’ve chosen <a href="http://emailjs.org">emailjs</a> for delivery that would also be a great moment to connect it to your email account (e.g. a Gmail&nbsp;account): </p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="keyword">var</span> smtpServer  = email.server.connect({
   user:    yourEmail, 
   password: yourPwd, 
   host:    yourSmtp, 
   ssl:     <span class="literal">true</span>
});
</code></pre>
<p>The final preliminary step would be to tell Passwordless which storage interface you’ve chosen above and to initialise&nbsp;it:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="comment">// Your MongoDB TokenStore</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> pathToMongoDb = <span class="string">'mongodb://localhost/passwordless-simple-mail'</span>;
passwordless.init(<span class="keyword">new</span> MongoStore(pathToMongoDb));
</code></pre>
<h1 id="delivering-a-token">Delivering a&nbsp;token</h1>
<p><code>passwordless.addDelivery(deliver)</code> adds a new delivery mechanism. <code>deliver</code> is called whenever a token has to be sent. By default, the mechanism you choose should provide the user with a link in the following&nbsp;format:</p>
<p><code>http://www.example.com/token={TOKEN}&amp;uid={UID}</code></p>
<p><code>deliver</code> will be called with all the needed details. Hence, the delivery of the token (in this case with emailjs) can be as easy&nbsp;as:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">passwordless.addDelivery(
    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(tokenToSend, uidToSend, recipient, callback)</span> {</span>
        <span class="keyword">var</span> host = <span class="string">'localhost:3000'</span>;
        smtpServer.send({
            text:    <span class="string">'Hello!\nAccess your account here: http://'</span> 
            + host + <span class="string">'?token='</span> + tokenToSend + <span class="string">'&amp;uid='</span> 
            + <span class="built_in">encodeURIComponent</span>(uidToSend), 
            from:    yourEmail, 
            to:      recipient,
            subject: <span class="string">'Token for '</span> + host
        }, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(err, message)</span> {</span> 
            <span class="keyword">if</span>(err) {
                console.log(err);
            }
            callback(err);
        });
});
</code></pre>
<h1 id="initialising-the-express-middleware">Initialising the Express&nbsp;middleware</h1>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">app.use(passwordless.sessionSupport());
app.use(passwordless.acceptToken({ successRedirect: <span class="string">'/'</span>}));
</code></pre>
<p><code>sessionSupport()</code> makes the login persistent, so the user will stay logged in while browsing your site. Please make sure that you’ve already prepared your session middleware (such as <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/session">express-session</a>)&nbsp;beforehand.</p>
<p><code>acceptToken()</code> will intercept any incoming tokens, authenticate users, and redirect them to the correct page. While the option <code>successRedirect</code> is not strictly needed, it is strongly recommended to use it to avoid leaking valid tokens via the referrer header of outgoing <span class="caps">HTTP</span> links on your&nbsp;site.</p>
<h1 id="routing-authenticating">Routing <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Authenticating</h1>
<p>The following takes for granted that you’ve already setup your router <code>var router = express.Router();</code> as explained in the <a href="http://expressjs.com/4x/api.html#router">express&nbsp;docs</a></p>
<p>You will need at least two URLs&nbsp;to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display a page asking for the user’s&nbsp;email</li>
<li>Accept the form details (via&nbsp;<span class="caps">POST</span>)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="comment">/* <span class="caps">GET</span>: login screen */</span>
router.get(<span class="string">'/login'</span>, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(req, res)</span> {</span>
   res.render(<span class="string">'login'</span>);
});

<span class="comment">/* <span class="caps">POST</span>: login details */</span>
router.post(<span class="string">'/sendtoken'</span>, 
    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(req, res, next)</span> {</span>
        <span class="comment">// <span class="caps">TODO</span>: Input validation</span>
    },
    <span class="comment">// Turn the email address into a user <span class="caps">ID</span></span>
    passwordless.requestToken(
        <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(user, delivery, callback)</span> {</span>
            <span class="comment">// E.g. if you have a User model:</span>
            User.findUser(email, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(error, user)</span> {</span>
                <span class="keyword">if</span>(error) {
                    callback(error.toString());
                } <span class="keyword">else</span> <span class="keyword">if</span>(user) {
                    <span class="comment">// return the user <span class="caps">ID</span> to Passwordless</span>
                    callback(<span class="literal">null</span>, user.id);
                } <span class="keyword">else</span> {
                    <span class="comment">// If the user couldn’t be found: Create it!</span>
                    <span class="comment">// You can also implement a dedicated route </span>
                    <span class="comment">// to e.g. capture more user details</span>
                    User.createUser(email, <span class="string">''</span>, <span class="string">''</span>, 
                        <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(error, user)</span> {</span>
                            <span class="keyword">if</span>(error) {
                                callback(error.toString());
                            } <span class="keyword">else</span> {
                                callback(<span class="literal">null</span>, user.id);
                            }
                    })
                }
        })
    }),
    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(req, res)</span> {</span>
        <span class="comment">// Success! Tell your users that their token is on its way</span>
        res.render(<span class="string">'sent'</span>);
});
</code></pre>
<p>What happens here? <code>passwordless.requestToken(getUserId)</code> has two tasks: Making sure the email address exists <em>and</em> transforming it into a unique user <span class="caps">ID</span> that can be sent out via email and can be used for identifying users later on. Usually, you’ll already have a model that is taking care of storing your user details and you can simply interact with it as shown in the example&nbsp;above.</p>
<p>In some cases (think of a blog edited by just a couple of users) you can also skip the user model entirely and just hardwire valid email addresses with their respective&nbsp;IDs:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="keyword">var</span> users = [
    { id: <span class="number">1</span>, email: <span class="string">'marc@example.com'</span> },
    { id: <span class="number">2</span>, email: <span class="string">'alice@example.com'</span> }
];

<span class="comment">/* <span class="caps">POST</span>: login details */</span>
router.post(<span class="string">'/sendtoken'</span>, 
    passwordless.requestToken(
        <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(user, delivery, callback)</span> {</span>
            <span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">var</span> i = users.length - <span class="number">1</span>; i &gt;= <span class="number">0</span>; i--) {
                <span class="keyword">if</span>(users[i].email === user.toLowerCase()) {
                    <span class="keyword">return</span> callback(<span class="literal">null</span>, users[i].id);
                }
            }
            callback(<span class="literal">null</span>, <span class="literal">null</span>);
        }),
        <span class="comment">// Same as above…</span>
</code></pre>
<h1 id="html-pages"><span class="caps">HTML</span>&nbsp;pages</h1>
<p>All it needs is a simple <span class="caps">HTML</span> form capturing the user’s email address. By default, Passwordless will look for an input field called <code>user</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">html</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">body</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">h1</span>&gt;</span>Login<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">h1</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">form</span> <span class="attribute">action</span>=<span class="value">"/sendtoken"</span> <span class="attribute">method</span>=<span class="value">"<span class="caps">POST</span>"</span>&gt;</span>
            Email:
            <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">br</span>&gt;</span><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">input</span> <span class="attribute">name</span>=<span class="value">"user"</span> <span class="attribute">type</span>=<span class="value">"text"</span>&gt;</span>
            <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">br</span>&gt;</span><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">input</span> <span class="attribute">type</span>=<span class="value">"submit"</span> <span class="attribute">value</span>=<span class="value">"Login"</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">form</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">body</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">html</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<h1 id="protecting-your-pages">Protecting your&nbsp;pages</h1>
<p>Passwordless offers middleware to ensure only authenticated users get to see certain&nbsp;pages:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="comment">/* Protect a single page */</span>
router.get(<span class="string">'/restricted'</span>, passwordless.restricted(),
 <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(req, res)</span> {</span>
  <span class="comment">// render the secret page</span>
});

<span class="comment">/* Protect a path with all its children */</span>
router.use(<span class="string">'/admin'</span>, passwordless.restricted());
</code></pre>
<h1 id="who-is-logged-in-">Who is logged&nbsp;in?</h1>
<p>By default, Passwordless makes the user <span class="caps">ID</span> available through the request object: <code>req.user</code>. To display or reuse the <span class="caps">ID</span> it to pull further details from the database you can do the&nbsp;following:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">router.get(<span class="string">'/admin'</span>, passwordless.restricted(),
    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(req, res)</span> {</span>
        res.render(<span class="string">'admin'</span>, { user: req.user });
});
</code></pre>
<p>Or, more generally, you can add another middleware that pulls the whole user record from your model and makes it available to any route on your&nbsp;site:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">app.use(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(req, res, next)</span> {</span>
    <span class="keyword">if</span>(req.user) {
        User.findById(req.user, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(error, user)</span> {</span>
            res.locals.user = user;
            next();
        });
    } <span class="keyword">else</span> { 
        next();
    }
})
</code></pre>
<h1 id="that-s-it-">That’s&nbsp;it!</h1>
<p>That’s all it takes to let your users authenticate securely and easily. For more details you should check out the <a href="https://passwordless.net/deepdive">deep dive</a> which explains all the options and the <a href="https://github.com/florianheinemann/passwordless/tree/master/examples/simple-mail">example</a> that will show you how to integrate all of the things above into a working&nbsp;solution.</p>
<h1 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h1>
<p>As mentioned earlier, all authentication systems have their tradeoffs and you should pick the right system for your needs. Token-based channels share one risk with the majority of other solutions incl. the classic username/password scheme: If the user’s email account is compromised and/or the channel between your <span class="caps">SMTP</span> server and the user’s, their account on your site will be compromised as well. Two default options help mitigate (but not entirely eliminate!) this risk: Short-lived tokens and automatic invalidation of tokens after they’ve been used&nbsp;once.</p>
<p>For most sites token-based authentication represents a step up in security: users don’t have to think of new passwords (which are usually too <a href="http://splashdata.com/press/worstpasswords2013.htm">simple</a>) and there is no risk of them reusing passwords. For us as developers, Passwordless offers a solution that has only one (and simple!) path of authentication that is easier to understand and hence to protect. Also, we don’t have to touch any user&nbsp;passwords.</p>
<p>Another point is usability. We should consider both, the first time usage of your site and the following logons. For first-time users, token-based authentication couldn’t be more straight-forward: They will still have to validate their email address as they have to with classic login mechanisms, but in the best-case scenario there will be no additional details required. No creativity needed to come up with a password that fulfils all restrictions and nothing to memorise. If the user logins again, the experience depends on the specific use case. Most websites have relatively long session timeouts and logins are relatively rare. Or, people’s visits to the website are actually so infrequent that they will have difficulties recounting if they already had an account and if so what the password could have been. In those cases Passwordless presents a clear advantage in terms of usability. Also, there are few steps to take and those can be explained very clearly along the process. Websites that users visit frequently and/or that have conditioned people to login several times a week (think of Amazon) might however benefit from a classic (or even better: two-factor) approach as people will likely be aware of their passwords and there might be more opportunity to convince users about the importance of good&nbsp;passwords.</p>
<p>While Passwordless is considered stable, I would love your <a href="https://github.com/florianheinemann/passwordless">comments and contributions</a> on GitHub or your questions on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/thesumofall">@thesumofall</a>.</p>
